# BlindPoint Supply - Laravel E-Commerce Project

## Project Overview
BlindPoint Supply is an e-commerce website selling fire-rated, antimicrobial roller blinds to institutional buyers (schools, nurseries, care homes, clinics, commercial landlords).

## Key Differentiator
Compliance documentation - every product ships with BS 5867 fire certificates, antimicrobial specs, and material data sheets. This is what separates us from Amazon sellers.

## Tech Stack
- Laravel (latest)
- SQLite database (simple, portable)
- Blade templates
- Tailwind CSS
- Alpine.js for interactivity
- Stripe for payments

## Product Structure
Roller blinds have:
- 4 sizes: 60x120cm, 90x120cm, 120x120cm, 180x120cm
- 4 colours: White, Light Grey, Stone, Charcoal
- Compliance attributes: fire_rating, antimicrobial, wipe_clean, child_safe
- Uploadable PDFs: fire certificate, spec sheet

## Pricing
- All prices stored and displayed ex VAT
- VAT calculated at checkout (20%)
- Trade accounts get 15% discount (configurable per account)
- Free shipping over £75, otherwise £5.95

## User Types
1. Guest - can browse and checkout
2. Trade Account - must apply and be approved, gets trade pricing
3. Admin - manages everything

## Database Models Needed
